               ==============================================
                         MACSIMUS version file
                   (with history, bugs, and to-do list)
               ==============================================

BUG AND TO-DO LIST
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
KEY is priority or severity (0=unimportant, 9=important, X=critical)

cook:
  9 Langevin thermostat not sufficiently implemented, Gear only:
    with -m4 gives *** Too low virial pressure vs. tensor accuracy
    consider DOI: 10.1080/00268976.2012.760055
    also, tau.T should be reinterpreted (double it and modify random force)
  9 Andersen thermostat issues:
    AndersenCM thermostat wrong for TIP4P (not SPC) -- why?
    Andersen wrong for RTIL -u9999 (all bonds vibrating)
    Andersen with elst. field suspicious
    Andersen thermostat not as accurate as expected (No.f problem?)
    low-T crashes if restarted with Andersen
  9 Elst+mag field virial of force and pressure tensor unclear (never use NPT)
  9 pressure/pressure tensor accuracy problems for PERSUM, -m4: see projects/tests/constrdyn/cangles/
  9 Ewald issues:
    parm(): "just calculate charges" should be cleaned!!!
    Ewald autoset via error estimate out of order for polarizable molecules with no or small charges (ponder such molecules in elst. field)
    Ewald error estimates use the assumption that charges are distributed randomly which overestimates (several times) the errors for dipolar models
    Off-diag pressure tensor has not been tested for GAUSSIANCHARGES
    +? consider Ewald cutoff=const*L for NPT
  8 if LINKCELL is used on a few molecules, it crashes (see BUG in lc.C)
  8 rehack the .cp creation logic in the .cpi spirit to avoid maincps.c and simmeas.c synchronization and empty column |M| or |J| if lag.M/lag.J not set
  8 rescale="XY" does not work correctly with Lx,y,z set and tau.rho
  8 reconsider slab autocenter by sites, not molecules
  8 the kinetic pressure correction is not without caveats - do not trust the defaults and consult the manual
  8 add pressure tensor components corresponding to the external elst field
  7 NPT + diffusivity/SF should be checked again (perhaps OK for cube only)
  6 POLAR: improve numerical errors: see locEnel-README.txt
  6 tau.sat<0 cannot be started with init=2 because it is changed to init=1 in a wrong place, or the order of setup is wrong
  6 Gear+Nose does not survive direct start, must (a few cycles) run Berendsen first
  5 parallelized structure factor probably out of order
  5 k-vector initialized in Ewald even w/o charges - crash for dilute systems
  5 cutelst Ewald unnecesarily initialized, with alloc problems
  5 SLAB: (?) vdrift in x,y not autoset - doublecheck!
  5 POLAR elst energy/forces rounding problems (<.1K/charge) for shell=1000
  4 cutelst requires PRESSURETENSOR for only shape change (tau.rho)
  3 writing plb may be shifted by h or so for long runs (1us) - rounding problems
  3 keyword LJ in SIMNAME.cpi out of order (in most versions)
  3 extend Rgyr to the whole config. (cf. mXsection,cXsection), doublecheck Rgys vs. moment of inertia
  3 cutelst: should choose which pressure to use for barostat
  3 add ~M^2 term to energy also in non-Ewald
  2 make 14 inclusion in rdf switchable (now: 14=on in plain version, 14=off in link-cell list)
  2 omit 1-4 at all if not needed (e.g., distance14=0)
  2 key="sort+z" problems, use sort="z"
  2 clean the free version (misleading info about boxes...)
  2 clean simcg (allocate M in bigger chunks)
  2 omit M/J from .cp as default?
  1 siminit: loop (n,0,option('m')+3) sdsralloczero(a[n],i): 3 too many?
  1 should warn if positive Emin in ble-file
  1 improve Emax for debug pot -v31
  1 double vector[4] support? (better cache usage, but speed gain ~1% only)
  1 is it necessary to call rhs at init if Verlet?
  1 LJcutoff=0 should turn off LJ (workaround: use option -j#)
  ? technical problem: calc.c uses rndgen.c
  ? virtual volume change for rescale!="xyz" and constrained model? Use kinetic pressure tensor components?
  ? it happended that one zero-length cycle was executed after stop was reached, but I cannot reproduce it anymore...
  ? QQTAB and qtype&4 optimization (for BK3+ions)
  ? problem of large noise in Jx,Jy,Jz caused by water - split measurements?
  ? unroll intermol() for m1==m2 and m1!=m2 ?
  ? LJ cutoff/constrained models/small boxes and the virtual volume change method
  ? LJ cutoff and virtual volume change small boxes
  = WARNINGs *** box has changed by >5% (log-scale) and k-vectors remain unchanged and  *** cutoff=11.000000 exceeding minL/2=10.000000 by 10.00% unnecessarily printed even if no charge
  = doublecheck the Yeh-Berkowitz correction (now in all 3 directions, equivalent to eps'=0)
  = thermostat="NPT" rescale clash when started from init=3
  = sometimes enthalpy = internal energy
  = Selected #defines: printed to stderr is not the same as printed to prt
  - when rescaling (load.n[]), automatic cutoff determination is incorrect (will not be fixed but noted in the manual)
  - automatic corr setup fails if thermostat/barostat changed within one run (e.g., Berendsen -> NPT) - noted in the manual, will not be fixed

blend:
  8 tetrahedral dependants => 5 bonds (one missing)
  8 implement Gaussian charges
  7 "shake" with "dependants" not supported
  7 Gaussian charges not supported
  6 hot keys ,; with -b0/-a0 change the number of steps; remedy: <Esc> sd=999; <Enter>
  5 warn about positive Emin in nbfixes
  4 extend plb2plb also to mol and gol files
  3 blend: more fool-proof logic if .che changes (check time stamp?)

other:
  9 change home-made int4.h into standard stdint.h
  7 `makepept charmm22 ace G ct1' incorrectly replaces CT2 by CT1 and charge in G
  5 showcp -c -l - blocking not needed, -c strange printout, also Cov
  5 showcp change int to unsigned to allow for 2^32-1 records (not 2^31-1)
  5 showcp ignores column number with -a
  4 showcp does not read .cpz with -f -t (full range is OK)
  3 water (hoh) translated into internal name (TIP3P) and TIP3P.mol interferes with molcfg. Workaround: use the model names like TIP3P, not hoh etc.
  3 show: -@ out of order, the follow mode fails
  ? random numbers: Mersenne Twister instead of Ziff?
  ? pgcc does not compile random numbers
  ? show shows last frame as empty for old plb format
  = cppak crash

  - reverse endian support removed

cook 3.3p:
  + dielectric constant calculation (partly) returned to CUTELST version
  * default el.epsinf changed to 3e33 also for cut-off electrostatics, but
    it is used in postprocessing only (no term ~|M^2| as in Ewald - to be
    added?)

    - walls require "#define SLAB 1" and are dynamically set by structure wall.*
    - pressure on walls calculated
  * virial-of-force terms added to wall calculations (the virial pressure

    statistics (formerly, +Lx,+Ly,+Lz had to be given in .cpi file, which
    can be easily forgotten)

cook 3.1h:
  ! tau.T of Langevin thermostat was wrong (correlation time of velocity of
    ideal gas) so that the correlation time of temperature was tau.T/2.
    Fixed - tau.T is now the correlation time of temperature

cook 3.1g:
  ! linked-cell list was wrong for fully flexible models because of a
    new bug in 1-4 control
  ! metal force field contained incorrectly measurements every step; thus,
    some quantities (as RDF) were multiplied by noint - fixed

plot 2.0i:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2016-08-05 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.9e:
  ! fully flexible models did not work under linked-cell list because
    the 1-4 predictor was turned off and the bonded forces were not
    calculated - fixed

cook 2.9d:
  + D/r^8 added to exp-6, #define POW used instead of REP12

cook 2.9c:

  + control of volume, V(t), using external file SIMNAME.box, t added

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2015-11-15 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.8d:
  * some prints cleaned (no dielectric constant if ions)
  + partial currents by ion types added

cook 2.8c:
  * default PRESSURETENSOR changed to 3
  * unit of Wcl in .cp changed to Pa (as statistics), was K/A^2
  * Ein as the 4th column of .cp for NVT removed, rho applies unless

    The energy/forces checker reports problems, which are WARNINGs only.
  - No.lcth removed (always the same # of threads for r- and k-space
    with PARALLEL=1)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2015-09-17 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.8a:
  + Support of different energy units in the ble-files (not in the
    ble-files generated by blend). This solves the following caveat:
    ! Some force fields (e.g., Buckingham, see MACSIMUS/sim/buck)
    ! had additional parameters (C and D) in kcal/mol, however,
    ! the same parameter in the table nbfixes must have been given in
    ! internal units (Kelvin, or R/kcal=0.0019872041), i.e., as printed
    ! when cook -v7, or multiplied by kcal/R = 503.219565.
    The new scheme defines the units in structure Epow_s in
    macsimus/sim/<nonbond>/sitesite.c.  Variable  eunit  defines the
    unit in which energies are given in the ble-file.  eunit is given in
    p.u. (loosely, Kelvin), the default is Eunit/kcal = R/kcal (R=gas
    constant).
    The nbfixes table uses the same unit as the site-site table (no
    exception for parameters C,D for the Buckingham potential).
    FOR FORCE FIELD WITH EXTRA ENERGY PARAMETERS, THE NEW nbfixes
    TABLE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE OLD ONE!
  ? function finite() to detect numeric problems was replaced by isfinite(),
    because finite() did not detect nan in some cases when optimizing on.
    It is assumed and verified that isfinite(0) returns 1,  although the
    man page says it should return 0, which does not make sense.

cook 2.7v:
  ! bug fixed - automatic -a0 (invalid for Gaussian charges) removed from
    the back calculation of diffusivity; note to plb2diff added
  + synopsis slightly changed (cook* SYSNAME.ble SIMNAME.get allowed)
  * Busing-style of the exp-6 potential extended to Gaussian charges
    (good for Baranyai-Kiss water and ions)

cook 2.7u:
  + switch SS_DEBUG changed to variable poteps
  + adjusting size potential parameter extended to cross-terms (fia nbfixes)
  * constants updated for CODATA 2010

cook 2.7t:
  ! reported energy cutoff corrections in the slab version
  * aesthetical changes of the cleaving algorithm, units changed

cook 2.7s:
  + Zone melting ensemble (NLxLyPzzE), see tau.L, box.Lx[], box.Ly[]

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2015-01-08 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.7q,r:
  ! Gaussian charges for ions - bugs fixed

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2012-06-28 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.7o,p:
  ! small change/fix of X-section

cook 2.7m:
  + Gaussian charges added (switch GAUSSIANCHARGES, tested for COS)
  + qq-based r-space Ewakd tables added (switch QQTAB)
  + eps14 added (should be improved in future)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2013-08-28 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.7l:
  + Tstop added (stop if temperature reached)
  + keywords Ekin added to .cpi

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2013-04-03 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.7k:
  * Default el.rshift changed to 3, warnings improved
  ! Bug fixed: normal mode vibrations of constraint models were wrong for
    certain combinations of masses because of numeric underflow in the matrix
    inversion procedure

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2012-12-11 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.7j:
  + Cross-section extended to the whole configuration
  + Normal modes with constraints now may call octave to calculate
    eigenvalues - faster, but more memory consuming.
    New input variable: nm.method (see the manual)

cook 2.7h:
  ! The diagonal components of the pressure tensor for the dipolar Ewald term
    were wrong (its trace and thus the isotropic pressure were correct).
    The error was zero for tinfoil.
    Surface tension with Berkowitz correction was affected, but the
    correction is negligible in any practical setup. The same holds for
    optimizing crystal shapes
  ! POLAR saturation autoset: ref. dipole moment includes the induced part
    (bug: was permanent)

cook 2.7g:
  + Support for automatic determination of el.epsinf and Eelst to
    reach given saturation: new variables sat and tau.sat
    If Eelst=0, el.epsinf is adjusted:
       use keyword "xinf" in SIMNAME.cpi to monitor 1/(2*epsinf+1)
    If Eelst[2]!=0, Eelst[2] is adjusted (must be positive):
       use keyword "Ez" in SIMNAME.cpi to monitor
  + tau.sat<0 will copy the average to the controlling variable
    and start init="append" run

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2012-06-28 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.7f:
  * el.sf default changed to 0 even if option -f
  * el.epsinf<0 no longer means the Berkowitz slab correction - see el.slab
  + el.slab: the Berkowitz slab correction
  - option -\\ removed, use environment NSLOTS and variable No.lcth
  ! no distance check as the default (-d0, was incorrectly -d1)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2012-06-20 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.7e:
  * An attempt was made to improve performance of the linked-cell method,
    esp. if parallel, using different organization of data.
    See compile-time switch LINKCELL.
    The results are very architecture and data dependent.

cook 2.7d:
  * precision loss due to q^2 constant term and Ewald correction of Drude
    charges further improved (see exacterud_sqrt_1())
    Still there is error ~<100 kPa in the pressure tensor (different
    versions may differ because summing contributions in different orders)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2012-06-01 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.7c:
  + el.rshift added (shift erfc splines to avoid jumps, test print)
    el.rshift=3 recommended for normal modes
  + el.rplus added (instead of compile-time switch ERFCPLUS)
  * (in some POLAR versions) precision improved by NOT summing large
     q+q- erfc terms to the alpha/sqrt(pi) sum q^2 constant term
     The error <1K/molecule or 50 kPa in pressure was thus reduced several times

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2012-05-25 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.7b:
  * option -x (optimized code, LJ terms for some water models) changed,
    warnings added - less automatic, but more fool-proof
  * equalize allowed in .def only (ignored if in .get)
  + normal mode vibrations (BUG: not for general constraint models with
    variable angles between fixed bonds, good enough for rigid models)
    New variables: nm.ampl, nm.dr, nm.eps, nm.frames, nm.modes, nm.zero
    See the manual!

Utilities cfg2asc, asc2cfg added (for editing the configurations by hand)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2012-03-31 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.7a:
  + MTK thermostat+barostat
  * format of .cfg files changed, utility cfgconv provided for conversion
  + fundamental frequencies (for vibrating bonds only, to be extended)
    variables nm.dr, nm.eps, nm.frames
  + cutoff correction control (variable corr) extended
  + statistics and convergence profiles of enthalpy, pot+kin energy
  - load.reversed (support of reversed endian) removed

blend 2.2f:
  + dump screen a bit changed
  + -w80 now writes a configuration in the (V2.7a) format of cook

ice.c etc.:
  + ices II,III,V,VI,VII

  ! serious bug fixed in showing H-bonds
  * small changes

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2011-11-11 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.6k:
  ! bug fixed (reset of Nose variable log(s) if the thermostat changes)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2011-10-26 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.6j:
  + variable key added, to be used to execute commands and (later) also
    replace quit and sort
    e.g., key="cp" (without ending ;) will pop up convergence profiles
  + three versions of cook added to the basic installation

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2011-10-18 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.6i:
  + variable el.Perr added (to control WARNING in the case of pressure tensor trace/virial discrepancy)
  * variables densprof.* changed to slab.*
  * however, densprof.slab -> slab.mode
  + slab-based thermostat: slab.T slab.Tz0 slab.Tz1
  * slab-based forces in the z-direction moved from center.* to slab.*
  + non-Nose thermostat forces Nose variables:=0
    (NOT to remember these variables if other thermostat was run meanwhile)
  + 3D structure factor added, el.sf=1 = radial SF, el.sf=3 = 3D SF
  * format and name of the radial SF changed
  + corr extended:  1=cutoff corrections included in final results, not in P for the barostat
                    2=cutoff corrections included (also in barostat)
    the default is now corr=2, which the same as before

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2011-07-13 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
plb2diff:
  + fit of MSD(t) to a+b+c/t^1/2 (w. hydrodynamic tail) now optional
    with PLB2DIFF=3 (old linear fit = PLB2DIFF=2 = default)

cutprt:
  ! bug fixed (new table not recognized - some output omitted)

staprt:
  + -kr added (relative standard error)

cook 2.6h:
  + rho printed with standard error estimate
  * option -[ removed, use data:
    load.n[] = replicate factors
    load.L[] = change L option
    load.N   = change N option
    load.tr  = load transformation
  * option -] removed - use variable equalize instead (default = no equalization = 0)
    CAVEAT: only some variables allowed to calculate equalize, e.g.:
            allowed:  noint=5 h=.01/noint equalize=0.8*(h>0.0015)
            error (NOT REPORTED): equalize=cleave.K>10
    (see the manual or code for details)
  * option -@ changed to -@WHO@WHERE (send e-mail if job finished)
    old -@ available as  No.occup

plot:
  * mouse changed: left=digitize (no doubleclick needed)
                   right=place file info
  + ctrl-a,b.. = assign 0 to parms

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2011-05-11 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.6g:
  * harmonics and full correlation function of water (old feature) revisited
  + el.centroid added (default=0, old default=1):
    1 = old default = dipole moments of ions are w.r.t. molecule charge centroid
        problem: total dipole moment is not a sum of ion moment
    0 = dipole moments of ions are w.r.t. coord. center
        total dipole moment = sum

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2011-04-22 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
show 2.0f:
  + dump EPS added (hot key E)
  * old duplicate hot key E removed (use tabulator to rotate by 90 deg)
    Hint: this is the tabulator in bash: $'\t'
    Example (show slab horizontally):
      show -I%$'\t' molfile slab.plb
  + environment variable SHOWPAL added - number of palette entries
    (default = 249, practical minimum is about 100)
    Example (slow connection):
      SHOWPAL=66 show molecule
  + oraNge (browN) color added, used for marking, -N<PATTERN> in recoloring

cook 2.6f:
  + fluctuating charge FQ4 model
    o direct and LINKCELL supported
    o BUG: FQ4--DRUDE interaction not yet
    o CAVEAT: not tested with POLAR&4
  * some variables renamed:
    epsp -> scf.eps
    omegap -> scf.omega
    epspx -> scf.epsx
    epspq -> scf.epsq
    maxitp -> scf.maxit
    new variable: scf.omegax (relaxation parameter for virtual volume
                  change method)
    negative scf.eps, scf.epsx: abs. value determines the number of
                                iterations (scf.maxit irrelevant)
  * output names of box and dipole moments changed
  * formula for the dielectric constant improved (see the manual)
  * legacy code allows loading old names and dielectric constant
    recalculation
  * change of defaults: el.epsinf=1 for cutoff electrostatics

  several bugs fixed by T. Trnka:
  ! -v logic in blend
  ! slab geometry problems: auto set the number of degrees of freedom with z-forces
  ! init cfg with z-forces and with shell-core model (crash - term missing)
  ! z-profile if not autocenter (crash - undef. variable)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2011-02-22 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
statics.c (cook, autocorr, showcp):
  * In the statistics module, the "automatic" determination of error
    estimates was improved.  It is now uniformly good even for cases
    like long negative corelations (e.g., Ptzz for liquid slab+water).
    There is a certain tendency to underestimate the error, though.
    The new formula takes a weighted average over several blocked
    estimates, both without c_1 and with it. (The old version took a
    maximum, which in case of negative correlations overestimated the
    error, however, is more prone against underestimation.)
    The default blocking was increased to 2^15.
Several bugs fixed thanks to Tomas Trnka:
blend 2.2d:
  ! determination of the vdw radius for exp-6 was wrong - fixed
  + verbose output of pair potential parameters
  * -v (verbosity) option changed
cook 2.6e:
  ! load cfg with POLAR<->NONPOLAR conversion and old version was fixed
  ! En.Hz requires PRESSURETENSOR

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2011-02-17 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
show 2.0e
  * -a changed: now -aAN determines max rotation angle as 2*PI/AN,
    the initial rotation angle is initial (PI/8)/AN
    default AN=4
    E alternate for TAB (standard orientations)
cook 2.6d: (wrong version number)
  ! automatic centering bug fixed

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2011-02-01 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.6d:
  ! number of degrees of freedom for AndersenCM and MaxwellCM was wrong - fixed
  + simplified Langevin thermostat (canonical in the long tau.T limit)
  + Gibbs interfacial energy by the cleaving method - see the manual
  * density profile measurements improved (as regards z-periodicity)
  + automatic centering of the z-profile (see densprof.sp)
  ! the slab for surface tension calculations (slab corrections) need not
    be centered
  * densprof.zmax=0 means scaled density profile in [0,Lz] divided
    into density.grid
  * dt.plb<0: frame not written for t=0 (init>=2)

show 1.0d:
  + key K (markallmode) added
  + save plb (^S) saves the marked subset (if SELECTION)
  * I = invert marking, TAB = reset (orientation)
  ! bug fixed (buffer overflow, discovered by Radek Vostal)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2010-11-22 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.6b:
  ! caveat fixed: now can read playback and then write it again
  + name of input playback accepted (argument PLBNAME.plb; if missing,
    SIMNAME.plb is used), can be further used even if further
    processed (option -[)
blend 2.2b:
  + GUI support, hot key Ctrl-S (save) added

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2010-10-18 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.6a, blend 2.2a:
  * new simplified interface to implement potentials and combining rules:
    see MACSIMUS/sim/ssdecl.h and example MACSIMUS/sim/lj/
  + Buckingham potential extended
  + The van der Waals radii (exported via GOL-file to show) are now
    calculated because the Buckingham parameters are not directly
    related to the atom size.  If the atom-atom potential does not
    have a minimum, R=r1*1.12, where U(r1)=1 kcal/mol, is used instead.
    (This radius is then rescaled by option -p).
  * parameter sqrt_rule changed to comb_rule

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2010-10-07 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.5h:
  + Buckingham support added to cook and blend (see sim/buck+12s), various
    combining rules; the D/r^12 term can be turned off by switch -DNO12REP
  + as above - the shell-core polarizable version
  ! wrong masses in some parts of the algorithm with mass equalization -]
    (probably only some normalization was imprecise)
show 1.1b:
  ! numbering improved, plb can shring during viewing, better looking box..

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2010-09-29 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.5g:

  ! bug fixed (surface tension output)
  + Nose-Hover for Verlet+SHAKE implemented via velocity predictor
    switch SHAKEVELOCITY renamed to VERLET
  * options -_ and -p changed:
    -pKPC (dec. digits):
      K = k (predictor length, parameter of ASPC or similar)
      P = polar method (order of the method):
          0=Car-Parrinello-like (0th order, no extra thermostating)
          1=no prediction
          2=ASPC
          3,4=higher-order (with Gear only)
      C = velocity predictor length, Verlet+SHAKE (-m2) + Nose-Hover only
          (default C=2 => energy drift O(h^5))
          constraint predictor order, Gear only (-m#, #>2)
          (default = -m value)
     -_ = inactive now - changed into P above
  + support for out-of-plane dependants (as Lone pair in some water models)
    incl. the pressure tensor
    Not available via blend!

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2010-06-01 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.5e:
  + diffusivity now also for NPT (cubic box), uses L from plb
  * epslc replaced by box.rmin, code changed to shift normalization

  - runtime environment variable GUIPATH should point to macsimus/guimenu

cook 2.5d:
  ! several bugs fixed by Tomas Trnka
  ! cutoff electrostatics bug of 2.5c fixed
  ! bug in setting atomatom2() fixed

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2010-04-14 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
blend 2.1l:
  + 1-4 interactions with POLAR implemented: all charge-charge terms
    are multiplied by factor14 (as if diel.const.=1/factor14)
  ! shell-core (repulsive antipolarization) changed:
    polar=2 removed from .par file (while polar=4 still means ADIM)
  + table "shellrep" added in par-files.
    The shell-core term is the interaction between (A) a polarizable
    atom and (B) repelling atom.
    (A) is usually anion with a large polarizability, it has nonzero
    kappa (arep) in the table "polaratoms"
    (B) is usually cation with none or small polarizability. These
    cations are now listed in table "shellrep".
    WARNING: not compatible with older versions - you must add table
    shellrep to such force fields!
  + 1-4 polarizable interactions (scaled by factor14) are added to the polar
    versions. The shell-core term is ignored for 1-4
  ! infinite loop w. -b0/-a0 fixed
  + -q also suppresses warning "fractional charge"
    hint: use -q100 to suppress the warning and keep charges unchanged

cook 2.5c(?):
  + bit optimized for monoatomic molecules and no LINKCELL
  * verbose output set in case of POLAR bad iterations if this happens
    for the second time
  * POLAR: option ^ changed (-^+EEEEOO: +EEEE=shell, OO=omegap in %)
  + POLAR: 1-4 polarizable terms added
    supported: FREE, cutoff elst, Ewald; LINKCELL, shell-core (POLAR&1)
    suppoted but not tested: ADIM (POLAR&64)
  - POLAR&32 removed (cf. table "shellrep" in the par-file)

show 1.0d:
  + dihedral angle info printed if 4 atoms clicked

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2010-03-11 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.5b:
  + another warning for a small non-rigid molecule (forgotten -h in blend)
    pressure tensor double checked for POLAR&1
  ! the suggested timestep was calculated from the initial masses even if
    option -] which might have lead to a misleading info - fixed
  ! memory leak for PARALLEL=1+Ewald fixed

blend 2.1k:
  * options -a0, -b0 improved: minimization with constraints is now smooth
  + constrained dihedrals added. They should be written in file SPECIES.jet as:
    IDi IDj IDk IDl ANGLE
    the angle is in degrees in interval (0,180)
    BUGs : cos(angle) is used internally, 0 and 180 are not allowed and
           the sign of ANGLE is not distinguished

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2010-03-02 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.5a:
  + code (re)parallelized using threads
    PARALLEL=1: linked-cell list parallelized
    PARALLEL=2: ewald k-space runs in parallel with pair forces (r-space)
    example (SGE):
      qsub -cwd -b y -pe shm 2 ./cookewslcp0P2 polwater slab -t
  - switch CLOCK removed
  * time measurement (-t) upgraded
all:
  * option -DSCR removed from modules in show, blend and util
    (#include in che-files still works)
    it is left for cook because it enables $iFILE in input data
molcfg:
  ! problems with molcfg called from cook again...fixed
plot:
  * wrong input data treated as NaN and not plotted

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2010-02-16 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
blend 2.1j:
  * -h no longer automatic with registered waters (warning printed)
cook 2.4p:
  + info/warning added for inappropriate timestep h (based on min. mass)
plbreplicate:
  ! fixed

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2010-02-08 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.4o:
  * init=4="slab" make a slab (cheap random with z-center bias)
  + check of a registered water model
blend 2.1i:
  + variable "water" exported in the ble-file (=registered water model)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2010-02-06 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.4n:
  ! bug (wrong pressure tensor components in cook 2.4m) fixed

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Releases 2010-01-05, 2010-01-22 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
WARNING: bug in pressure tensor components

show 1.0c:
  + editing of a configuration added, toggle mode by m (the same as blend)
  + save one frame by ctrl-s
  + unmark by M or ctrl-u (compatibility with blend)
  * hot keys m M (match configuration) renamed to ' "
  + if the mol-file does not match the plb-file, the mol (and gol) file info
    is either repeated or truncated
  + if mol/gol file is missing, just spheres are used
  * DOS support finally removed
    (show 1.0b/DOS frozen as show4dos.c and showidos.c)
blend 2.1h:
  * `x' no longer allowed as the character for crossing bonds in a che-file,
    use `+' instead (`x' interferes with the `:ID' constrct)
  + blend now prints a "soft warning" if the par-file contains "void" data
    lines which do not start with a table name (like if an accidental Enter
    appears within the data)
  * hot key M (used to be floodfill) now means unmark all (cf. show)
    (floodfill is midclick - the middle button is now common, so that
    it is not necessary to use a key)
cook 2.4m:
  + option -] added: equalize masses of atoms in molecules
  + option -q-# changed: now a charged system is neutralized by adding
    a constant charge to all charges (old meaning "do not rotate" is now -j-#)
  * option -j-# changed: now it means "do not rotate while initializing"
    (formerly -q-#)
  + variable  initvel  added: reinitialize velocities of initvel molecules
    (the same as former -j-#)
    initvel is reset to 0 after velocities assignment
  * the definition of the pressure tensor was standardized - now without
    factor 1/3
    Note that the reported values were 1/3 of the pressure, which was
    written in the manual, but misleading
  + time autocorrelations functions:
    time scale is always in ps, conversion to SI should include factor 1e-12
    off-diagonal pressure tensor (-> viscosity), if lag.visc
    current (-> conductivity), if lag.cond
    velocity-velocity (-> diffusivity), #ifdef RGYR, if lag.v
      (for molecules to lag.nv, lag.dim coordinates)
  * lag ranamed to lag.err, lag2 to lag.n
  + molcfg not called if -f specified
cp2cp:
  ! bug found (option -d did not work properly)
    options replaced by (more general) -r and -h
showcp:
  * cleaned, some options changed:
    -e (all columns) removed
    -[ -] changed to -e
    -c extended
    -xDT becomes -hDT -x
    -hDT set time step (=noint*h)
  + can print also time autocovariances (-c2)
  + -n added: number of blocking 2^
cook, showcp, autocorr, staprt:
  + now dt recorded and time axis printed
    (may be confused if old/new sta-files are mixed)
plb2diff:
  ! bug fixed (int overflow if too long plb-file and too many blocks)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-11-30 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

blend 2.1g:
  + option -g-# : no graphics, minimization protocol printed
    by # steps (default = guess)
show 1.0b:
  + show hydrogen bonds. Example:
      show iceVMq3288 -DH4I -AO4I -HB2.4
    (donor site type=H4I  acceptor=O4I  distance limit=2.4 A  color=Blue)
  - option -_ removed (not clear what it was good for)
  * bond allocation was made dynamic
    (option -i is now the initial number of bonds - may be removed in future)
  + box around (-\\ = -|) can be now any color (e.g., -\\B)
cook 2.4l:
  unchanged (no bug in Ptens)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-11-18 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  * getline() renamed to mygetline() because of clash with a new GNU library
cook 2.4l:
  + el.diff added
  * tau.rho now forces rho in column 4 of SIMNAME.cp (the same as tau.P)
  * info plb: ... moved to -v4 verbosity level
  * (somewhere around this version)
    statistics not automatically calculated for variables in .cpi
    (can be returned back by + prepended, e.g., "+Lz")
blend 2.1f:
  + option -w80 added (make .cfg for cook)
plbcut:
  ! serious bug fixed in array allocation
show 1.0a:
  + option -J added (more flexible "show shell"). Example:
      show -j6 -Jb xxx
    will show waters (= molecules with 'b' in their id's) around the 1st
    molecule
    Note: 'b' appears if molcfg is automatically called from cook and
    water is the second molecule (N[1])
hbonds:
  + extended to allow a solute

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-09-18 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.4k:
  + variable corr added (whether LJ cutoff corrections are to be included)
  ! severe bug fixed: LJ without charges in nonpolar versions had bad
    cutoff and the molecules "exploded". This bug was introduced while
    "cleaning" the code, several versions affected.
  * the 1-4 predictor in the LINKCELL version is now safer and prints
    more helpful warning messages
  + Andersen and Maxwell thermostats working on centers of mass
    they are safe with constrained dynamics
  * some renaming: "intermolecular" degrees of freedom/kin. energy/temperature
    are now called translational (calculated from the center of mass)
    "Tmol" in .cp is renamed to "Ttr"
    "Tkin inter" (in .sta) renamed consistently to "Ttr"
    "Tkin intra" (in .sta) renamed consistently to "Tin"
    "T" (in .sta and .cp) renamed to "Tkin", to be distinguished from
      the thermostat value Tkin
    "Tinter_intra" renamed to "T_tr_in"
  * the default rescale was changed to 15
  + examples/sample.def: file with the most common variables and options
show:
  options added:
    -[# frames moved in keys []; -[-# the same in %
    -]0 MOLNAME.gol will be ignored
  filename argument logic cleaned:
    - 1st arg can be MOLNAME or MOLNAME.mol or MOLNAME.gol or MOLNAME.plb
    - optional 2nd arg must be with extension, preferably PLBNAME.plb
      (.plb is then stripped off in derived names)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-09-09 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
cook 2.4j:
  ! In the linked-cell+polar versions, the RDF contributions were calculated
    every step instead of every cycle. The resulting RDFs were thus noint
    times larger and the code somehow slower.
  ! Wrong number of inter/intramolecular degrees of freedom (with Berendsen
    thermostat and NVE) - fixed.
    (This bug in versions 2.4k and older introduced an inaccuracy of the
    order of 1/N to Tkin inter and Tkin intra. The correct values can be
    easily obtained by multiplying by wrong_degrees/good_degrees)
  * -k option was changed and manual updated
blend 2.1e:
  + hot key @m writes file MOLNAME.mark with marked sites
  + hot key @k writes file MOLNAME.keep with kept (frozen) sites
  + -k extended (-k4 reads FILE.keep, -k8 reads FILE.mark)
mol2mol:
  this utility can provide various operations with mol, gol, and plb files
  It can also read MOLNAME.mark etc mentioned above
show:
  ! bad 'L' (write plb) if new format - fixed
  + match extended to a selection of sites (cf. blend above)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-07-30 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
showcp:
  + Braille subset of UTF-8 used to print a better pseudograph
    can be turned on/off by option -u (former -u renamed to -n)
  * the y-range of plot is now within min:max of the original data, not
    of the blocked data (=the same behavior as the pseudographs)
plot:
  * number of variables available for fitting increased to 10
  * some hot keys had to be changed:
    i: initial scaling is now U (or k)
    I: fit is now:
       ctrl-t in double,
       t in long double (recommended),
       T in highprec
    gG: show/hide grid is now zZ or oO

    Example of fitting:
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    tab 0 1 0.01 | \
      tabproc "A" "exp(A)+rnd(1)*0.1" 0.1 | \
      plot -:A:B:-:C :A:"a+b*A+c*A^2"
    Then, in the plot window, type `t'.
    It should compile a fitting program and plot a fit.
    The result is around a=1.0, b=0.8, c=0.8.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-07-22 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

cook 2.4i:
  ! malformed error message (rescaled too much) fixed
  + bulkmodulus added (for NPT and similar; if not set, ideal gas value used)

most software; e.g., showcp and ev:
  * terminal sizes are now determined from environment variables LINES and
    COLUMNS, not SCROLL
    Hint: in bash, add to your .bashrc:
      shopt -s checkwinsize
      export LINES
      export COLUMNS

blend 2.1d:
  ! temporary file now created using mkstemp(), which is save if run
    concurrently (on several nodes). (The price paid is that you must
    by hand remove temporary files if blend crashes.)
  ! format for constrained angles fixed (was slightly less accurate)
  ! blank lines allowed between header and parameter_set in a che-file
  ! undefined chirality is a warning only

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-06-11 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

cook 2.4h:
  ! -[-XXX (allow box change without rescaling while load) does not work
    FIXED (thanks to T. Trnka)
  ! rhoinit does not work - FIXED
  ! small bug fixed: report of energy/particle
  * padding spaces (to 4 chars) removed from names listed in SIMNAME.cpi
    (e.g., Lx)

blend 2.1c:
  * second virial coefficient improved

pdb V1.4b:
  ! incompatibility fixed - alternate locations can be now also in order
    AAABBB, not only ABABAB as before. Other orders (BA, etc.) are warning.

show:
  * init size according to box if available FIXED
  ! bug (something like box around for old .plb) FIXED

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-05-18 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

tabproc, plot:
  * 1000 columns now allowed (used to be up to Z=26)
    columns over Z=26 are accessible as #27 or c27, etc.

blend 2.1b:
  + second virial coefficient (options -V, -T, -R) added

cook 2.4g:
  * writing of playback files rehacked
    IMPORTANT CHANGE:
      Option -y-1 now means "write one molecule", NOT write the whole
      configuration. Do not use any option to write the full playback.
    Changes of -y:
      -yBIG (now the default!): write playback and call molcfg to prepare
            data for show
      -y##: write ## molecules only (into single SIMNAME.plb, not .p##),
            incl. a call to molcfg
      -y0:  do not write playback
      -y-##: as above, but do not call molcfg
    Input data changes:
      dt.plb=0: write at start and when a sweep (; in the data) is finished

  * normalizing drift and degrees of freedom cleaned:
    - variable `norm' removed
    + variable `drift' added
    + variable `conserved' added


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-04-07 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

cook 2.4f:
  + option -w extended to -w#, #>1:
    The same as -w1 and the available disk space is checked before selected
    files are written.  If not enough space is available, it waits several
    minutes (more for the second time) and then checks again.  The available
    space is compared to a rather pessimistic estimate of space needed plus
    # kB added (to be even more pessimistic). -w2 should be enough unless
    your co-workers often fill the disk in a very greedy way.  The algorithm
    is not 100% reliable, though.  It relies on a system call to df; if this
    fails for any reason, it is considered as no space and the program keeps
    waiting.  A warning is printed after space has appeared again; for
    apparent reasons, nothing is printed when the no-space condition is
    encountered.

  FIXED BUGS:
  ! tau.E+thermostat should be error - FIXED (warning+ thermostat off)
  ! something's wrong with reporting rho if tau.rho: after switching to
    tau.rho, the target rho is reported, but not actually reached
    (V there - not calculated) - FOUND, V was not correctly calculated
    (might have affected pressure...)
  ! xxx="xxx" in get data not error if key not defined - FIXED

  NEW:
  + plb2rdf, utility to calculate RDF from plb


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-04-07 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

cook 2.4e:
  + The Ewald error estimates updated for non-cube; see also the BUGS section
  * some electrostatic (Ewald) parameters renamed:
      alpha    -> el.alpha
      epsk     -> el.epsk
      epsr     -> el.epsr
      epsinf   -> el.epsinf
      minqq    -> el.minqq
      erfcgrid -> el.grid
      etest    -> el.test
  - parameter K removed (see el.kappa below)
  + parameters added:
      el.kappa: k-space cutoffs are K[] = el.kappa*L[]
                (old K was in the z-direction: old K = el.kappa*L[2])
      el.diag: include diagonal correction (good for salts),
               formerly available via #define INCLUDEDIAG


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-02-20 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

cook 2.4d:
  + The linked-cell list implemented now also for POLAR, tested with POLAR=0
  + Exclusions + EXACTERU (COULOMB=-2) implemented now with the link-cell:
    r-space errors caused by splines for Ewald summation of models with
    partial charges are now smaller


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-02-10 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

cook 2.4c:
  The logic controlling box size and rescaling was cleaned.
  * The "Reference box" is given by density rho and box L[0], L[1], L[2] in
      the input data:
    - if nonzero rho is given and some of L[i] are not given (or are zero),
      the remaining L[i] are calculated to reach given rho
    - particularly, if only rho is given and no L, a cubic box with
      calculated size (L[0]=L[1]=L[2]) is used
    - if either rho==0 or rescale&7==0 (i.e., no rescaling is allowed),
      L[i] are not changed; if any of them iz zero, this is error
    This "Reference Box" is used for:
    - setting cutoff (if not given explicitly)
    - setting Ewald parameters alpha,K from errors epsk,epsr (unless they
      are given explicitly)
  * The "Actual Box" is the box size during simulation. It may differ from
      the "Defined box" because:
    - such a box is read from previous run (init=0,1,2), initialized using
      initrho (init=3,4,5), read from ascii (init=10,11,12), read from
      plb-file (init<0), etc.
    - an NPT ensemble is used (or its variant with a component of the
      pressure tensor) which leads to variable L during simulation.
      This is set by nonzero tau.P
    - If nonzero tau.rho (but not tau.P) is specified, the system rescales
      the box gradually to reach "Defined Box"
    - If none of tau.P,tau.rho is specified, the "Defined Box" may differ
      from the actual box forever; this is not recommended (and warnings are
      printed)
  * Option -[-NNN forces (some) components of the Actual Box to be replaced
    by the "Define Box" values

  Options change:
    -[-NNN changed - see the manual
    -@ now reserved for LINKCELL only, removed from POLAR
    -_ now reserved for ASPC (parameter k) with Verlet+SHAKE only
    -w2 (write if cfg has changed) no longer supported,
        default = -w = always write
        (The reason is that it is difficult to trace all changes that a
        user may do with the configuration and determine whether the
        configuration has changed; a cfg may be restored from a backup
        SIMNAME.cfg~ if necessary.)

NEW and updated playback-related utilities:
  + plbstack - stack configurations at the level of plb-files
  + plb2cfg - convert plb to cfg (loadable by cook)
  + cfg2plb - convert cfg to plb (if you have forgotten -y-1)
  + plbreplicate - replicate cell at the level of plb-file
  * plbbox - change box
  * plbinfo - also reports prints all plb-related utilities


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Release 2009-01-15 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

blend 2.1a, pdb 1.4a:
  + new format (variable L) of .plb implemented
  * .plb made the default format, .3db (and .3dt) deprecated
    (.3db and .3dt can be still read/written on demand)
  * blend writes also .gol file as the default
    IMPORTANT NOTE: use distinct names for cook!
  + suboptions -y4, -y8, -y16 implemented (see manual)
