! LENGTHS can be given using several units:
!   123   in "Poscript" points of inch/72
!   123pt in "typographical" points of inch/72.27
!   12cm  in cm
!   99mm  in mm
!   3in   in inches

! TEXT can contain subscripts (_x), superscripts (^x) and symbols (\a)
! example (Theta in J/mol):
! \Q/(J mol^-^1)
! see also utility psstring

! === size of plot area (excl. labeling and margins)
w XSIZE YSIZE

! === plotting mode
m e ! mode EPS (default)
m l ! mode is PostScript landscape
m p ! mode is PostScript portrait (swaps xsize <--> ysize if used after w)

! === B/W mode
b ! replaces color lines/points by different style black

! === font (except Symbol denoted by \)
s SIZE [type]
! the default is:
s 14 Helvetica

! === x-axis labeling
x LEFT_MARGIN RIGHT_MARGIN X-AXIS TEXT
y BOTTOM_MARGIN TOP_MARGIN Y-AXIS TEXT
! the text may contain spaces

! === any text at x,y (# below stands for a decimal digit)
l x y TEXT    ! string to write; can use _Index ^Exponent \Symbol
l x y $#-TEXT ! as above, prepend by a line of style # (=1,2,3..)
l x y $#.TEXT ! as above, prepend by a symbol of style # (=1,2,3..)
l x y $#+TEXT ! as above, both keys (line+symbol)
l x y $#=TEXT ! as above, errbar
l +dx +dy STRING ! as above, with relative positioning
! Example (use \$ in scripts!):
l 100 100 $1-T=100 K
l +0 +20 $2-T=200 K

! === rotate the following text (applies to x,y,l):
r ANGLE ! in degrees

! === line thickness
t LINE_THICKNESS FRAME_AND_TICK_THICKNESS

! === make frame and tics - simple
f NX NY LENGTH ! NX = approx. # of labeled ticks in x
               ! NY = approx. # of labeled ticks in y
               ! LENGTH = tick length
! === make frame and tics - better
f -DX -DY LENGTH ! DX = distance between ticks (in graph units)
! this command may repeat, but labeling applies to the first f

! === set (change) styles of lines and points
NR R G B[,DASH,LINEWIDTH[,POINTSIZE,POINT]
! NR = line number, #=1,2
! R G B = color in PS style (from 0 to 1)
! DASH = dashes in PS style (without [], in pt): LINE PAUSE LINE PAUSE..
! POINTSIZE is in pt
! POINT = { square fullsquare opensquare circle fullcircle opencircle diamond fulldiamond opendiamond up fullup openup down fulldown opendown plus cross star dotcircle }
